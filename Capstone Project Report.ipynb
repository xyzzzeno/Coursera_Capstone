Among which, location is one of the most important influencers. For example, both school system quality and crime rates in a neighborhood are correlated with home price. Besides, nearby features, such as shopping centers, restaurants and other pulic entertainments could also affect home price. \nHowever, the siginificance of correlation between neighborhood and home price could vary with different areas. For example, nearby facilities might have less impacts on home price in less developed areas than other factors such as crime rates.\nHere, we will use New York City as an example, to examine how the count of entertainments, restaurants and shops affect home price in different neighborhoods. New York City is decribed as the cultutal, financial and media capital of the world, and it is a prominent location for the America entertainment industry. Therefore, entertainment might be an important component in New Yorker\u2019s daily life. We will explore whether entertaiments and restaurant density could affect home price in New York City.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### *Data*\nThe home price data in New York City will be used in this project is from NYC OpenData website (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DOF-Summary-of-Neighborhood-Sales-by-Neighborhood-/5ebm-myj7).
